# Worklog

Log of completed work (newest first). Each entry: what was done, tests, commit.

## 2026-07-14 — Phase 0 complete: pre-commit hooks + CI
- `requirements-dev.txt`: added `pre-commit`.
- `backend/scripts/precommit_check.py`: runs `ruff check .` then `pytest tests -q` from
  `backend/`, using `sys.executable` (whichever Python launched it) so it stays in sync
  with `backend/.venv` without hardcoding a path inside the script itself.
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (repo root): one local hook, triggers only when a `backend/`
  file is part of the commit. `entry` had to be an **absolute** path to
  `backend/.venv/Scripts/python.exe` — a relative path failed with `WinError 2` because
  pre-commit's `language: system` on Windows resolves `entry` via PATH or as a literal
  absolute path, not relative to its cwd. (No usable system `python` exists on this
  machine's PATH — only a broken Microsoft Store alias — which is why the hook can't just
  bootstrap through a bare `python` command either.)
- Installed the hook (`pre-commit install`) and confirmed via
  `pre-commit run --all-files` → passed.
- `.github/workflows/backend-ci.yml`: ruff + pytest on push/PR to `main`/`develop`,
  Ubuntu + Python 3.12. Deliberately no `DATABASE_URL`/`CLERK_*` secrets configured — the
  test suite mocks `Settings` rather than hitting real Neon/Clerk, so CI needs none.
  Validated the YAML structure by parsing it with PyYAML.
- Phase 0 is now done end-to-end: FastAPI skeleton, Neon+pgvector, Clerk auth, Alembic,
  local pre-commit gate, CI. Next: Phase 1 (Subjects, upload/ingest, Ask/RAG).

## 2026-07-14 — Phase 0: Alembic init
- `requirements.txt`: added `alembic`.
- `alembic init alembic`; `alembic.ini` sqlalchemy.url left unset (no connection string
  duplicated in a committed file) — `env.py` reads `DATABASE_URL` from
  `app.core.config.get_settings()` instead, raising the same clear `RuntimeError` as
  `db.py`/`auth.py` if unset. `target_metadata = SQLModel.metadata`.
- `script.py.mako` template modernized (`from __future__ import annotations`, `X | Y`
  unions) so future auto-generated migrations pass ruff without hand-editing.
- First migration `fb44afd7a3d6_enable_pgvector_extension`: `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT
  EXISTS vector` / `DROP EXTENSION IF EXISTS vector` — codifies what was done manually
  in the Neon SQL editor earlier, so a fresh Neon DB can be set up from migrations alone.
- Ran `alembic upgrade head` against the real Neon DB; confirmed `alembic_version` table
  recorded `fb44afd7a3d6`. Full test suite still **8 passed**; ruff clean.

## 2026-07-14 — Phase 0: Neon + Clerk accounts verified live
- User created real Neon + Clerk accounts and filled `backend/.env` (gitignored, uncommitted).
- Caught secrets pasted into `backend/.env.example` (tracked by git, unlike `.env`) before
  any commit — moved real values to `.env`, restored placeholders in `.env.example`.
  `git status` confirmed clean; `git log` confirmed the secrets were never committed/pushed.
- Verified live: `get_engine()` connects to Neon (Postgres 18.4, `pgvector` extension
  confirmed enabled); `get_jwks_client()` fetches Clerk's real JWKS (1 key returned).

## 2026-07-14 — Phase 0: db.py + auth.py (Neon + Clerk wiring)
- Guided Neon (Postgres + pgvector) and Clerk account setup (external — user-completed).
- `requirements.txt`: added `sqlmodel`, `psycopg2-binary`, `pyjwt[crypto]`.
- `app/core/config.py`: added optional `database_url` / `clerk_jwks_url` / `clerk_issuer`.
- `app/core/db.py`: cached SQLAlchemy engine (`pool_pre_ping=True`) + `get_session` FastAPI
  dependency. Raises `RuntimeError` if `DATABASE_URL` missing, only when actually used.
- `app/core/auth.py`: `PyJWKClient`-backed JWKS fetch/cache, `decode_clerk_token` (RS256 +
  issuer check), `get_current_user_id` dependency → 401 on missing/invalid token.
- Tests: `tests/test_db.py` (2), `tests/test_auth.py` (4) — all isolated from real
  credentials/network (fake settings via monkeypatch; locally-generated RSA keypair for JWT
  signing). Full suite: **8 passed**; `ruff check` → clean.
- `pyproject.toml`: `extend-immutable-calls = ["fastapi.Depends"]` — fixes bugbear B008
  false positive on FastAPI's standard `Depends(...)` default-arg pattern.
- `.env.example`: uncommented `DATABASE_URL` / `CLERK_JWKS_URL` / `CLERK_ISSUER` now that
  code reads them.

## 2026-07-14 — Phase 0: backend foundation
- Created repo skeleton, `.gitignore`, backend package (`app/`, `app/core`, `app/modules`,
  `app/shared`, `tests`).
- FastAPI app + `/health` endpoint (`app/main.py`); typed settings (`app/core/config.py`).
- Python 3.12 `.venv`; installed fastapi, uvicorn, pydantic-settings + dev tooling
  (pytest, httpx, ruff); `pyproject.toml` (pytest + ruff config).
- Test `tests/test_health.py` → **1 passed**; `ruff check` → clean.
- Continuity docs: `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `docs/{plan,PROGRESS,DECISIONS,WORKLOG}.md`.
- Git: `main` + `develop` branches; commits `6e6ae33` (foundation), `7ee94b5` (push convention).
- GitHub: repo `Abdulatif90/StudyMate`; both branches pushed with upstream tracking.
