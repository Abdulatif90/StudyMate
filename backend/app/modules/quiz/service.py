"""Business logic for quizzes.

Two access shapes, matching the org-sharing model the rest of the codebase uses (single
source of truth: `subjects.service`'s `can_read_subject` / `require_readable_subject`):

- **Read / generate** (generate, list, get, list questions) are subject-READABILITY-
  scoped: the owner of a private subject, or any member whose active org owns the
  subject, may generate/read. A member generating over a teacher's org subject gets a
  quiz **owned by the caller** (per-student, like conversations and the flashcard side) —
  the shared thing is the source material, not the derived quiz.
- **Delete** is OWNER-only (a student can't delete a teacher's shared quiz).

Crucially, subject-readability alone is NOT enough for the read path: a non-owner reader
sees only the SUBJECT OWNER's quizzes plus their OWN — never another student's private
quiz on the same shared subject (their quizzes stay `owner_id`-scoped). The reader
variants below enforce `quiz.owner_id in {caller_id, subject.owner_id}`, mirroring the
flashcard `_reader_owner_filter` and its review-path fix.
